To identify keywords, programming languages, or skills, use emphasis like this:

*This text is in italics* - uses 1 single <b>*</b> at start & end of line

_This text is also in italics_ - uses 1 single <b>_</b> at start & end of line

**This text is bold** - uses 2 <b>**</b> at start & end of line

__This text is also bold__ - uses 2 <b>__</b> at start & end of line

_You **can** combine them_

<b>Note:</b> Use HTML tags for inline emphasis.
